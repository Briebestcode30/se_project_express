# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies & Techniques Used

- **Node.js** — server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** — web framework for routing and middleware
- **MongoDB / Mongoose** — database and object modeling
- **ESLint** (airbnb-base) & **Prettier** — code style and formatting
- **Validator** — data validation (URL checking, etc.)
- **Error handling constants** — centralized status codes
- **Nodemon** — hot reload for development

## Running the Project

- `npm run start` — launch the server
- `npm run dev` — launch the server with hot reload

### Testing

Before committing your code, edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For example: `12`
